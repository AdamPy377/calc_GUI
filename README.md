# calc_GUI
quite a simple calculator using the 4 basic operators (*, /, -, +), with a GUI interface including buttons and a label to display the total.

if you want to provide comments or assistance theyre appreciated as im relatively new to programming and could use the assistance if theres
anything that i could improve on just let me know.

It isnt meant to be the most functional thing, just a project i did to help myself learn tkinter. 

I would apreciate it if you didnt steal my code it probably wont matter as it isnt some scientific break through but thanks.
